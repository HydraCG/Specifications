# How to contribute

To advance Hydra, it is imperative that the community engages with us in discussing new and existing features. The only
way to hope for an end result useful for as many people as possible is for the actual interested parties to collaborate
throughout the process of building the Hydra's specification. This is the essence of an Open (Source) community.

This document gathers some guidelines which should help make this collaboration as smooth as possible.
These are not strict rules.

## Getting in touch

The best way to start contributing is to first spark some interest. This can be done by creating a GitHub issue
(more on that below) but a quicker alternative is to reach out to the community through on of our channels.

The more traditional, and traceable method is to sign up and contact us via the [mailing list][ml]. All messages
are stored in an archive and can be used as reference in the future.

[ml]: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-hydra/

As means of instant communication we're monitoring a `#hydra` channel on the HTTP APIs Slack. To register, please
go to http://slack.httpapis.com.

Finally, as mentioned before, GitHub is a great place to raise focused issues.
