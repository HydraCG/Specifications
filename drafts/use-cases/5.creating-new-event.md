## Entry point

### Story
As an application user
I want to be able to create new events manually
So I can have event's I'm aware of added to my calendar.

### Usage
```javascript
var event = {
    "eventName": "My brand new event",
    "eventDescription": "Hope it will work",
    "startDate": "2017-04-19",
    "endDate": "2017-04-19"
};
var client = new HydraClient();
var operation = client.get("/api").operations
    .filter(op => op.method == "POST" && expects == "schema.Event")[0];
client.invoke(operation, event);
```

### Details
Browsing events is a must, but creating a new resource is a brand new story.
First, my application have to be aware of how it can create a new resource.
It could get that information either from the API documentation or entry point
or last response's hypermedia controls. It also have to understand the type 
of resource in scope (unless it is provided from outside of the application, 
i.e. pass-through import from external data source).

Anyway, assuming all the requirements are met, a request would look like this:

```
POST /api/events
```
```javascript
{
    "eventName": "My brand new event",
    "eventDescription": "Hope it will work",
    "startDate": "2017-04-19",
    "endDate": "2017-04-19"
}
```

```
HTTP 201 Created
Location: /api/events/2
```

My new event should be now added to the calendar.

### Considerations

#### Protocol agnostc specification
While the most popular protocol in use is currently HTTP, ReST API can be implemented 
on top of other protocols. The example above has a weakness of being bound strictly to 
HTTP by referring to HTTP POST method. This has also another weaknes - server may also 
allow to create resources using HTTP PUT, more - it can forbid the POST method.
Specification could be protocol agnostic and give some hints on the logical functions 
of the operations.
This leads to another weakness - first thoughs can go in the CRUD direction, but these 
are not the only approaches available in the wilderness (not to mention that there are 
voices that put using CRUD in ReST API to question).

#### RIA editor form
It is common that rich UI applications allows their users to create/edit resources
via some forms full of inputs, lists etc. The question is - how these should be created.

The easiest approach is to hard-code these in the application. Well, if the application 
knows how to handle resources of type _schema:Event_, it would have some of the logic 
and views already prepared. The issue here is that it somehow puts the whole idea of 
meta-data. If we have tools to fully drive the client, why not use them?

Another, slightly better solution would be to embed some of that logic within the 
hypermedia controls. This is what happens when a HTML page has JavaScripts, CSS's and 
HTML forms embedded - client receives extra stuff to be used to show the form so it 
sends the resource back to the server. In our case though, it somehow puts on to our 
API a burdain of being aware of the client UI capabilities, which seems to be a dead end.

Ultimate solution would be to give the client all the details possible about the resource 
itself, it's structure, data types etc. so the client can use these on it's own.

We need to mention also a hybrid-like solution for non-UI applications. Server side 
could provide a _template_ of a resource to be filled with data. Still, the client would 
need some more details so the template receives correct values.
