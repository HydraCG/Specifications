## Advanced filtering of events

### Story
As an application user
I want to be able to filter my events according to various criteria
So I can find events I'm interested in.

As an API consumer
I want to be able to filter resources
So I can find those interesting to me.

### Usage
```javascript
let client = new HydraClient();
let events = client.get("/api/events");
if (events.search) {
    let filter = {};
    for (let mapping of events.search.mappings) {
        if (mapping.property === 'http://schema.org/name') {
            filter[mapping.variable] = ".*test.*";
        }
    }

    let query = urlTemplate.parse(events.search.template)
        .expand(filter);
    let data = client.get(query);
    for (let member of data.members) {
        // do something with the _member_, i.e. display it
    }
}
```

### Details
The application should be able to filter events with various criteria,
so the user can narrow number and relevance of the events displayed.
This should cover at least a scenario, where user filters events matching
multiple specific filtering criteria without diving into details
on how those criteria should be joined (i.e.: alternatives vs logical sum,
or more complicated cases like precedence and grouping).
Communication would look like this:

```http
GET /api/events
```

```http
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
    "@context": "/api/context.jsonld",
    "@id": "/api/events",
    "totalItems": 1,
    "members": [
        {
            "@id": "/api/events/1",
            "eventName": "Event 1",
            "eventDescription": "Some event 1",
            "startDate": "2017-04-19",
            "endDate": "2017-04-19"
        }
    ],
    "search": {
        "@type": "IriTemplate",
        "hydra:template": "http://example.com/api/events{?eventName}",
        "hydra:variableRepresentation": "hydra:BasicRepresentation",
        "hydra:mapping": [
            {
                "@type": "hydra:IriTemplateMapping",
                "variable": "eventName",
                "property": "http://schema.org/name",
                "required": false
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

```http
GET /api/events?eventName=.*test.*
```

```http
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
    "@context": "/api/context.jsonld",
    "@id": " /api/events?schema:eventName=.*test.*",
    "totalItems": 1,
    "members": [
        {
            "@id": "/api/events/1",
            "eventName": "Test event",
            "eventDescription": "Some event having a search phrase",
            "startDate": "2017-04-19",
            "endDate": "2017-04-19"
        }
    ]
}
```

There may be requirement of the client to send more complicated queries using different
methods as there are some formal limitations to query strings or URL length.
This requirement will be raised in another use case and won't be discussed with this one.

### Considerations

#### Is explicit page number or page size considered a filter
Having a possibility of explicitely defining which page
(how many members to skip and limit response to) might cover
some desktop applications, where grids of data are divided
into multiple parts with a pager and a page-size options available.

From technical point of view, this behavior could be achieved
with special purpose virtual predicates
(i.e.:  imaginatory hydra:limit and hydra:offset).
The argument against is that these are not direct properties
of resources being filtered.
Supporting argument would be that similar approach is used
in i.e. MS SQL pagination queries, where the row
(which can be a one-to-one relation to an entity in our cases)
is extended with a special purpose ROW_NUMBER value
on which filtering in the WHERE block can be performed.
