### Security considerations

#### JSON array root security issues
Due to security issues with JSON arrays which can be exploited in some circumstances,
there may be a need to avoid pure arrays in favour of a JSON object.
In the scenario above, server returned a single object, which won't cause issues.
But it is possible to return multiple resources, resulting in an JSON array returned
(server may not use any JSON-LD context or it may be completely different from the one used by the client).
There are several possibilities here. One of them would be to use a *@graph* notation, i.e.:

```json
{
    "@context": "/api/context.jsonld",
    "@graph": [
        {
            "@id": "/api",
            "@type": "hydra:EntryPoint",
            "examplevocab:events": {
                "@id": "/api/events",
                "title": "List of events",
                "@type": "hydra:Collection",
                "operation": [
                    {
                       "@type": ["hydra:Operation", "schema:CreateAction"],
                        "title": "Create new event",
                        "method": "POST",
                        "expects": "schema:Event"
                    }
                ]
            }
        },
        {
            "rdfs:label": "Some other resource somehow related to the main one."
        }
    ]
}
```

Using default graph seems reasonable, but implies some additional, possibly unwanted,
logic of the graph itself.
We could consider another approach or somehow standardize the graph name (if necessary).
