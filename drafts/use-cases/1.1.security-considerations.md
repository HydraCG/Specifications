### Security considerations

#### JSON array root security issues
Due to security issues with JSON arrays which can be exploited in some circumstances, 
there may be a need to avoid pure arrays in favour of a JSON object.
In the scenario above, server returned a single object, which won't cause issues.
But it is possible to return multiple resources, resulting in an JSON array returned 
(server may not use any JSON-LD context or it may be completely different from the one used by the client).
There are several possibilities here. One of them would be to use a *@graph* notation, i.e.:

```javascript
{
    "@graph": [
        {
            "@id": "/api",
            "operations": [
                {
                    "@id": "/api/events",
                    "title": "Events",
                    "httpMethod": "GET",
                    "returns": "hydra:Collection"
                },
                {
                    "@id": "/api/events",
                    "title": "Create new event",
                    "httpMethod": "POST",
                    "expects": "schema:Event"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "rdfs:label": "Some other resource somehow related to the main one."
        }
    ]
}
```

Using default graph seems reasonable, but implies some additional, possibly unwanted,
logic of the graph itself.
We could consider another approach or somehow standardize the graph name (if necessary).
