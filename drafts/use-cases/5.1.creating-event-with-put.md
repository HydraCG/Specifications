# Creating event with PUT

## Story

As an API publisher
I want allow consumers to construct event identifiers
So that they can control the URLs.

As an API consumer
I want to be able to create new resources idempotently
So I can retry safely.


## Usage

```javascript
var event = {
    '@context': '/api/context.jsonld',
    '@type': 'schema:Event',
    'eventName': 'My brand new event',
    'eventDescription': 'Hope it will work',
    'startDate': '2017-04-19',
    'endDate': '2017-04-19'
};

client.usingApi("http://example.com/")
    .findCollectionWith({
      property: "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type",
      object: "http://schema.org/Event"
      })
    .invoke('http://schema.org/CreateAction')
    .whichExpects('http://schema.org/Event')
    .withData(event)
    .getResult();
```


## Details

To create an `Event` using `PUT`, the collection resource has to advertise an action with a target for the operation.
The target of the operation can either be a concrete URL or an `IriTemplate` as shown in the example above. Concrete URLs are
out of scope for this use case and might be discussed at a later point in a separate use case document.

```http
GET /api/events
```

```http
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
    "@context": "/api/context.jsonld",
    "@id": "/api/events",
    "@type": "Collection",
    "manages": {
      "property": "rdf:type",
      "object": "schema:Event"
    },
    "totalItems": 0,
    "members": [ ],
    "action": {
        "@type": ["schema:AddAction", "schema:CreateAction"],
        "title": "create an event and add to collection",
        "operation": {
            "@type": "Operation",
            "method": "PUT",
            "expects": "schema:Event",
            "target": {
                "@type": "IriTemplate",
                "template": "http://example.com/api/events/{uuid}",
                "variableRepresentation": "BasicRepresentation",
                "mapping": [
                    {
                        "@type": "IriTemplateMapping",
                        "variable": "uuid",
                        "property": "schema:uuid",
                        "required": true
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We will assume that hydra client understands `schema:uuid` and will automaticaly generate [UUID v4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.4) and substituted variable in IRI template which maps to it.

Upon executing the snippet above the following request will be sent to the server:

```http
PUT /api/events/f94ebb70-bf47-4713-8486-386262ca2a12 HTTP/1.1
```

```json
{
    "@context": "http://example.com/api/context.jsonld",
    "@type": "schema:Event",
    "eventName": "My brand new event",
    "eventDescription": "Hope it will work",
    "startDate": "2017-04-19",
    "endDate": "2017-04-19"
}
```

``` http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```


## Considerations

### Requesting an existing URI

It is possible that the identifier constructed by filling in `IriTemplate` variables already contains a representation of
an event. By [definition](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.4) of the `PUT` method the server would replace the
resource if it already exists.

If that is not the intended behavior, the client should add `If-None-Match: *` to request headers. The [asterisk value
instructs the server to reject the update if any representation already exists][if-none-match].

```javascript
client.invoke(operationWithTargetExpanded, event, {
    headers: {
        'If-None-Match': '*'
    }
});
```

In such case it would respond with `HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed` status.


### Advertising connection between collection and created event

The `schema:AddAction` operation is advertised on the collection itself, which informs the client that the newly
created event will become part of the collection, i.e. it's `"member"` property. However, such operation can have an effect on
more that one related resource. Building upon this example, in a more elaborate setting creating a personal event could also
add that event to the events collection of all participants.

There can be many such cases and defining all possible side effect is currently outside of Hydra's scope.

That said, this technique can be used also outside the scope od collections.
