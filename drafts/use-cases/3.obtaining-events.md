## Obtaining events

### Story
As an API consumer
I want to be able to retrieve all members of a collection
So that I can process them further.

### Example
As an application user
I want to display all my events
So I can find out what awaits me in the nearest future.

### Usage
```javascript
var client = new HydraClient();
var data = client.get("/api/events");
for (var member of data.members) {
    // do something with the _member_, i.e. display it
}
```

### Details
Once the application obtained a discovered either from the entry-point or the API documentation URL to the
events, it sends a GET request to that URL and fetches the events:

```http
GET /api/events
```

```http
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
    "@context": "/api/context.jsonld",
    "@id": "/api/events",
    "@type": "hydra:Collection",
    "manages": {
      "property": "rdf:type",
      "object": "schema:Event"
    },
    "totalItems": 1,
    "member": [
        {
            "@id": "/api/events/1",
            "eventName": "Event 1",
            "eventDescription": "Some event 1",
            "startDate": "2017-04-19",
            "endDate": "2017-04-19"
        }
    ]
}
```

It is possible now to display one event in the calendar.
