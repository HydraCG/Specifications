## Entry point

### Story
As an application user
I want my application to consume an entry point for the Web API by providing a base URL
So I can start managing my events.

### Usage
```javascript
var client = new HydraClient();
var entryPoint = client.get("http://example.com/").getEntryPoint();
for (var operation of entryPoint.operations) {
    // do something with the *operation*
}
```

### Details
It is simple to imagine a situation, when an application has a base URL provided, i.e.
in a configuration or in the input field.
Once provided, the application is expected to connect to the entry-point of the Web API and download initial
details on what else can be done with that API from that very point.

```http
GET /api
```

```http
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "@context": "/api/context.jsonld",
  "@id": "/api",
  "@type": "EntryPoint",
  "collection": [
    {
      "@id": "/api/events",
      "title": "List of events",
      "@type": "Collection",
      "manages": {
        "property": "rdf:type",
        "object": "schema:Event"
      },
      "operation": {
        "@type": ["Operation", "schema:CreateAction"],
        "title": "Create new event",
        "method": "POST",
        "expects": "schema:Event"
      }
    },
    {
      "@id": "/api/people",
      "title": "List of people",
      "@type": "Collection",
      "manages": {
        "property": "rdf:type",
        "object": "schema:Person"
      },
      "operation": {
        "@type": ["Operation", "schema:CreateAction"],
        "title": "Create new person",
        "method": "POST",
        "expects": "schema:Person"
      }
    },
    {
      "@id": "/api/venues",
      "title": "List of venues",
      "@type": "Collection",
      "manages": {
        "property": "rdf:type",
        "object": "schema:Place"
      },
      "operation": {
        "@type": ["Operation", "schema:CreateAction"],
        "title": "Create new venue",
        "method": "POST",
        "expects": "schema:Place"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** The `events` property would need to be specified by the API. Hydra currently doesn't define any
concepts which would allow to reference collections and describe their items in more details.

With this details, client application is aware of two possible operations that can be made from that point:

- GET events
- POST an event

It is possible for a rich UI application with some fancy logic that would takes all
GET operations returning *Collection* and displays them in a main menu.

### Considerations

#### RDFS entailment and OWL Reasoning capabilities
Another thing is how far the client should be pushed into the reasoning process.
In the example above, both operations have their type explicitely expressed with *"@type"* keyword.
But in RDFS environment, it is possible to use only *method* and *expects* predicates,
which is fully legal as the entailment process would extend the resource */events* with additional
statement (in Turtle):

```ttl
[] a hydra:Operation .
```

This is due to fact that Hydra Core Vocabulary provides an *rdfs:domain* for *method* .
Unfortunately, many clients, especially browser based, won't use that process of entailment,
thus an explicit statement should appear so the client can easily discover all the operations.
