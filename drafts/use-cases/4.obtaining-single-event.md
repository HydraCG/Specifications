## Entry point

### Story
As an application user
I want to display details of a single event
So I can find out more about an event I'm interested in.

### Usage
```javascript
var client = new HydraClient();
var event = client.get("/api/events/1");
// do something with the _event_, i.e. display it in a details view
```

### Details
After displaying my events in a calendar, I'd like to browse details of a selected event.
I don't expect calendar will show all attributes, thus I'll have to show those outstanding ones
in a separate view (i.e. popup, new screen, you name it).
The application sends a GET request to the selected event's resource identifier:

```
GET /api/events/1

HTTP 200 OK
```
```javascript
{
    "@id": "/api/events/1",
    "eventName": "Event 1",
    "eventDescription": "Some event 1",
    "startDate": "2017-04-19",
    "endDate": "2017-04-19"
}
```

Now I see what a given event was about.

### Considerations

#### Expansion
Assuming that the application knows what kind of resource will be returned,
it could try to express what kind of details it would like to receive.
This is due to fact that again, the application is unsure what will come -
whole resource, properties with literal values only, or some other subset.
Expansion would be extremly useful for obtaining related resources, i.e. 
in case of an event application might want to expand attendees
(or at least some of their details).
This way some optimizations can be achieved when a single request obtains 
details that feed more than a single screen which may improve user experience.

#### Projection
Another interesting feature would be a possibility of projecting a resource.
We can easily imagine a situation when an application shows an edit form for
our event - in order to assign a value to the attendee property, some kind of 
UI element should be presented (let's say a search-as-you-type like input)
which would display projected resources - concatenation of the first and last name.

The issue here is that the syntax for such a feature would make the spec 
incredibly complex.
