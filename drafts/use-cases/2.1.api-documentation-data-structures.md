# API documentation data structures

## Story

As an application user
I want to be presented with some editor forms
So I can fill it with my data.

As an API consumer
I want to be able to fetch entry-point's supported classes
So I can pre-generate views and forms.


## Usage

```javascript
const client = new HydraClient();
const apiDocumentation = await client.getApiDocumentation("http://temp.uri/");
foreach (const supportedClass of apiDocumentation.supportedClasses) {
    views[supportedClass.iri] = generateViewFor(supportedClass);
}
```


## Details

There are situations when, e.g., Rich Internet Applications need to present a 
nice looking edit form for a data element. Previously, it was common to create 
that form by hard-coding it into the application, causing issues on data item 
structure updates.

By providing details on entry point's supported classes and their property details, 
it is possible to pre-generate that views (to some extend at least), so the 
client can be always up-to-date with it's structure and presentation.

Communication would look like this:

```http
GET /
```

```http
HTTP 200 OK
Link: </api-documentation>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#apiDocumentation"
```

```http
GET /api-documentation
```

```http
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
    "@context": "/api/context.jsonld",
    "@id": "/api-documentation",
    "@type": "hydra:ApiDocumentation",
    "supportedClass": [
        {
            "@id": "schema:Event",
            "supportedProperty": [
                {
                    "@type": "hydra:SupportedProperty",
                    "property": "schema:eventName"
                },
                {
                    "@type": "hydra:SupportedProperty",
                    "property": "schema:eventDescription"
                },
                {
                    "@type": "hydra:SupportedProperty",
                    "property": "schema:startDate"
                },
                {
                    "@type": "hydra:SupportedProperty",
                    "property": "schema:endDate"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

By composing both payload and context client can gain knowledge on how the data 
element structure looks like (i.e. properties, their names and data types).
With this knowledge it is possible to i.e. generate generic HTML views for 
editing or creating data items or to support dynamic IRI template composition.
