# Searching for events

## Story

As an application user
I want to be able to quickly search through my events
So I find events I'm interested in.

As an API consumer
I want to be able to search through a collection of resources
So I can find those interesting to me.


## Usage

```javascript
var client = new HydraClient();
var operation = client.get("http://example.com/api/events")
    .getOperationOfType('http://schema.org/SearchAction');
if (operation) {
  var templateVariables = {
    hydra.freetextQuery: "Hydra"
  }
const operationWithTargetExpanded = operation.expandTarget(templateVariables);
client.invoke(operationWithTargetExpanded);
}
```


## Details

The application should be able to search through events,
so the user can narrow down the number and importance of the events displayed.
This would be simple search scenario without diving into how the
search phrase is interpreted by the server and how it is used while searching.
Communication would look like this:

```http
GET /api/events
```

```http
HTTP 200 OK
```

    "@id": "/api/events",

                ]
            }
        }
    }

```http

```

```http
HTTP 200 OK

    ]
