## Adding existing resources to collections

### Story
As an application user
I want to be able to add people to the list of event attendees
So I know who attended the event

As an application user
I want to be able to add event to the list of events I attended
So I can keep track on events I attended

As an API consumer
I want to be able to add existing resources to collections
So I can create various meaningful associations

### TODO

* define operation for adding existing resources to a collection [Issue#134](https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/issues/134)

### Details

Each event can reference a collection which acts as list of the attendees

```http
GET /api/events/1
```

```http
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
    "@context": "/api/context.jsonld",
    "@id": "/api/events/1",
    "@type": "schema:Event",
    "eventName": "Event 1",
    "collection": {
      "@id": "/api/events/1/attendees",
      "title": "List of attendees",
      "@type": "Collection",
      "manages": [
        {
          "property": "rdf:type",
          "object": "schema:Person"
        },
        {
          "subject": "/api/events/1",
          "property": "schema:attendee"
        }
      ],
      "operation": {
        "@type": ["Operation", "schema:AddAction"],
        "title": "Add event attendee",
        "method": "LINK",
        "expects": "schema:Person"
      }

    }
}
```

Similarly, each person can reference a collection which lists the events this person attended:



```http
GET /api/people/1
```

```http
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
    "@context": "/api/context.jsonld",
    "@id": "/api/people/1",
    "@type": "schema:Person",
    "schema:name": "Alice Foobarion",
    "collection": {
      "@id": "/api/people/1/attended",
      "title": "List of attended events",
      "@type": "Collection",
      "manages": [
        {
          "property": "rdf:type",
          "object": "schema:Event"
        },
        {
          "property": "schema:attendee",
          "object": "/api/person/1",
        }
      ],
      "operation": {
        "@type": ["Operation", "schema:AddAction"],
        "title": "Add attended event",
        "method": "LINK",
        "expects": "schema:Event"
      }

    }
}
```

In both cases the `schema:AddAction` operation expects an existing resource (with an `@id`) and just adds it to collection's `member` array. Unlike `schema:CreateAction` explained in [5.creating-new-event.md](https://github.com/HydraCG/Specifications/blob/master/drafts/use-cases/5.creating-new-event.md)
