      Linked Data can be published and accessed on the Web in a variety of ways.
      This document specifies the <em>Triple Pattern Fragments</em> interface,
      designed for low-cost Linked Data publishing
      and efficient client-side execution of several common types of queries.
      Each Triple Pattern Fragment contains
      those triples of a dataset that match a specific triple pattern,
      together with the estimated total number of matching triples,
      and hypermedia controls to find all other Triple Pattern Fragments of the dataset.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Interfaces to Linked Data</h3>
      <p>
        Linked Data [[LINKED-DATA]] consists of structured links between pieces of data.
        For example, we can link the concepts “Thomas” and “Nikola”
        with a “knows” relationship: <code>Thomas knows Nikola</code>.
        Yet this alone cannot be interpreted unambiguously.
        Which Thomas and Nikola are we talking about?
        And what does “knowing” mean in this context?
      </p>
      <p>
        We use URLs to clearly and unambiguously identify each of those
        three pieces of information:
      </p>
<pre><code>&lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Edison&gt;
      &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows&gt;
              &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikola_Tesla&gt;.
</code></pre>
      <p>
        If you, or a machine, want to know which
        “<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thomas_Edison" target="_blank">Thomas</a>”,
        “<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nikola_Tesla" target="_blank">Nikola</a>”, or
        “<a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows" target="_blank">knows</a>”
        is mentioned, you can simply follow their URLs.
        This is the essence of Linked Data,
        and the above snippet depicts a Linked Data triple in the RDF model [[RDF11-CONCEPTS]].
        RDF data exists in various concrete syntaxes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>JSON-LD [[JSON-LD]] allows to express Linked Data in the JSON format.</li>
        <li>RDF triple formats such as Turtle [[TURTLE]] use a triple-based syntax.</li>
        <li>RDF triples can be embedded in HTML through RDFa [[HTML-RDFA]].</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Just like HTML, RDF is simply a format for documents—publishers
        can choose freely how they divide data across different documents.
        Each server determines which interface it chooses to offer Linked Data.
        Some of them might publish a few large documents with millions of triples,
        others might give access to very specific, on-demand parts of a dataset.
        In order to communicate with each other,
        clients and servers can reuse agreed-upon interfaces,
        each of which comes with its own balance of advantages and disadvantages.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Aim, scope, and intended audience</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of a <em>Triple Pattern Fragments</em> server-side interface
        is to provide low-cost access to Linked Data,
        and enable efficient live querying over the dataset on the client side.
      <p>
        This document defines <em>Triple Pattern Fragments</em>,
        a <a href="../linked-data-fragments/">Linked Data Fragments</a> type,
        by specifying their representation and effect on the application state.
        This allows to publish and consume Linked Data
        through a Triple Pattern Fragments interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document is intended for people who want to implement
        a client or server of Triple Pattern Fragments,
        or for those who want to understand how such clients or servers work.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Document conventions</h3>
      <p>
        We write triples in this document
        in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/">Turtle RDF syntax</a> [[!TURTLE]]
        and use the following namespace prefixes:
      </p>
<pre><code>PREFIX rdf:   &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;
PREFIX hydra: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#&gt;
PREFIX void:  &lt;http://rdfs.org/ns/void#&gt;
PREFIX foaf:  &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;

    <h2>Document type</h2>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In essence, every client–server interface is characterized by two components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What kind of <em>requests</em> can clients make?</li>
        <li>
          With what kind of <em>responses</em> do servers reply,
          or in other words, what <em>document types</em> do they use?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These essential design decisions also determine
        <a href="#bib-LINKED-DATA">Linked Data</a> interfaces,
        through which a server publishes <a href="#bib-RDF11-CONCEPTS">RDF triples</a>
        from one or more datasets.
        Each Linked Data interface answers the above two questions differently.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>Triple Pattern Fragments</em> interface, which is defined in this document,
        answers those questions as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clients can ask for a <em>triple pattern</em>.</li>
        <li>To each <em>triple pattern</em> request,
            servers respond with a <em>Triple Pattern Fragment</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A Triple Pattern Fragment contains all triples from the interface's dataset
        that match the requested triple pattern, together with metadata and hypermedia controls.
        The remainder of this section precisely defines
        Triple Pattern Fragments and their components
        using the <a href="#bib-HYDRA-LDF">Linked Data Fragments</a> conceptual framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Triple Pattern Fragments interface consists solely
        of the definition of the Triple Pattern Fragment document type.
        No protocol-specific details are specified,
        since each Triple Pattern Fragment contains hypermedia controls
        that explain in-band how clients can engage in an interaction through a specific protocol.
        This means that, given one Triple Pattern Fragment,
        a client can consume the entire interface.
        As an example, the application of Triple Pattern Fragments to the HTTP protocol
        is detailed in <a href="#server"></a>.

      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>Triple Pattern Fragment</dfn>
        is a Linked Data Fragment [[!HYDRA-LDF]] of a dataset that consists of three parts:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>data</dt>
        <dd>
          A Triple Pattern Fragment MUST contain
          all triples of the dataset that match a given triple pattern
          “<code>?subject ?predicate ?object.</code>”.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          A Triple Pattern Fragment MAY additionally contain other triples of the dataset.
        </dd>
        <dt>metadata</dt>
        <dd>
          A Triple Pattern Fragment MUST contain a triple
          with a <code>void:triples</code> predicate
          that expresses the estimated total number of matches for the triple pattern.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          A Triple Pattern Fragment MAY contain additional metadata.
        </dd>
        <dt>hypermedia controls</dt>
        <dd>
          A Triple Pattern Fragment MUST contain hypermedia controls
          that allow retrieval of any other Triple Pattern Fragment of the same dataset.
          This MUST be provided as a form
          that allows to choose subject, predicate, and object of the selector's triple pattern.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          A Triple Pattern Fragment MAY contain additional hypermedia controls.
          In particular, the IRIs of the entities of the data, metadata, and control triples
          SHOULD be dereferenceable.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        A Triple Pattern Fragment of a dataset is fully determined
        by its <dfn>triple pattern selector</dfn>.
        In its most abstract form,
        a triple pattern selector consists of three components
        <code>subject</code>, <code>predicate</code>, and <code>object</code>
        [[!RDF11-CONCEPTS]].
        The <code>subject</code> MUST either be a variable or an IRI;
        the <code>predicate</code> MUST either be a variable or an IRI;
        the <code>object</code> MUST either be a variable, an IRI, or a literal.
        These components MUST NOT be blank nodes.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Triple Pattern Fragment is considered <dfn data-lt="empty Triple Pattern Fragment">empty</dfn>
        if it does not contain any data triples (regardless of metadata and controls).
      </p>

      <p>
        The above constraints define the Triple Pattern Fragment document type,
        and are detailed in the following sections
        <a href="#data"></a>, <a href="#metadata"></a>, and <a href="#controls"></a>.
        Triple Pattern Fragments SHOULD be paged, as detailed in <a href="#paging"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Triple Pattern Fragments are not bound to a specific syntax,
        since the data, metadata, and controls can be represented in different ways.
        The server MUST, however, support at least one RDF-based representation.
        Servers MUST indicate the corresponding MIME type
        when responding with a Triple Pattern Fragment,
        so clients can correctly parse it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For RDF syntaxes without multiple graph support
        (such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle</a>
        or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/">N-Triples</a>),
        the data, metadata, and controls MUST necessarily be serialized to the same graph.
        For RDF syntaxes with multiple graph support
        (such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a>,
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/trig/">TriG</a>
        or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/">N-Quads</a>),
        the data MUST be serialized to the default graph
        and the metadata and controls MUST be serialized to one or multiple non-default graphs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="data">
      <h3>Data</h3>
      <p>
        The data of a Triple Pattern Fragment is obtained
        by selecting all triples of a dataset
        that match the fragment's triple pattern selector.
        These triples SHOULD be ordered in some consistent way,
        such that Triple Pattern Fragments can be paged consistently.
        Triples SHOULD NOT contain blank nodes
        (if the original triples contain blank nodes,
        they SHOULD be <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-skolemization">skolemized</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        If the RDF syntax supports multiple graphs,
        data triples MUST be serialized to the default graph.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="metadata">
      <h3>Metadata</h3>
      <p>
        Each Triple Pattern Fragment,
        and each page of a Triple Pattern Fragment,
        MUST contain the estimated total number of triples that match the fragment's selector.
        This MUST be expressed as a triple with the following components:
      </p>
      <dl class="triple">
        <dt>subject</dt>
        <dd>the IRI of the fragment</dd>
        <dt>predicate</dt>
        <dd>the <code>void:triples</code> predicate</dd>
        <dt>object</dt>
        <dd>an integer literal expressing the estimated total number of matching triples</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The estimate MUST be a non-negative, finite, integer number with the following properties:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If no triples match the selector, the estimate MUST be zero.</li>
        <li>If one or more triples match the selector, the estimate MUST NOT be zero.</li>
        <li>The estimate SHOULD be as close as possible to the actual number of matches.</li>
        <li>
          If the number of matching triples is smaller than the number of items per page,
          the estimate SHOULD be exactly the number of matching triples.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The metadata MAY additionally contain variations of the above triple.
        For instance,
        it is RECOMMENDED to add a triple with the same subject and object
        and the <code>hydra:totalItems</code> predicate.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the RDF syntax supports multiple graphs,
        metadata triples MUST be serialized to a non-default graph.
        This non-default graph SHOULD be explicitly related to the Triple Pattern Fragment
        (for instance, using the <code>foaf:primaryTopic</code> predicate),
        so clients can interpret what resource this metadata belongs to.
        This graph MAY be the same as the graph containing the hypermedia controls.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="controls">
      <h3>Hypermedia controls</h3>
      <p>
        Each Triple Pattern Fragment,
        and each page of a Triple Pattern Fragment,
        MUST contain a hypermedia control that can generate the IRI
        of each other Triple Pattern Fragment of the same dataset.
      </p>
      <p>
        This control MUST act as a function that
        accepts three parameters <var>subject</var>, <var>predicate</var>, and <var>object</var>,
        each of which can either be
        a variable, a constant IRI, or (in the case of <var>object</var>) a constant literal.
        It MUST then map these parameters
        to the IRI of the dataset's Triple Pattern Fragment
        whose selector has the given parameter values.
      </p>
      <p>
        This control MUST be expressed as a form in the
        <a href="http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/">Hydra Core Vocabulary</a> [[!HYDRA-CORE]]
        using triples with the following structure:
      </p>
<pre><code>&lt;http://example.org/example#dataset&gt;
    void:subset &lt;http://example.org/example?s=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Ftopic&gt;;
    hydra:search [
        hydra:template "http://example.org/example{?s,p,o}";
        hydra:mapping  [ hydra:variable "s"; hydra:property rdf:subject ],
                       [ hydra:variable "p"; hydra:property rdf:predicate ],
                       [ hydra:variable "o"; hydra:property rdf:object ]
    ].</code></pre>
      <p>
        The above snippet assumes the dataset IRI is
        <code>http://example.org/example#dataset</code>,
        the fragment (or fragment page) IRI is
        <code>http://example.org/example?s=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Ftopic</code>,
        and the IRI template [[!RFC6570]] to retrieve Triple Pattern Fragments of the dataset is
        <code>http://example.org/example{?s,p,o}</code>.
        It furthermore assumes that the parameter names of
        <var>subject</var>, <var>predicate</var>, and <var>object</var>
        are <code>s</code>, <code>p</code>, and <code>o</code>, respectively.
        All of these MUST be adjusted to fit the configuration of a specific fragments server.
        Note that the form MUST be attached to the <em>dataset</em>,
        as the form filters the dataset and not the fragment,
        and the <em>fragment</em> MUST explicitly be listed as a subset of the dataset,
        in order to indicate the relation between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
        This hypermedia control MUST be present
        because there purposely does not exist a fixed IRI format
        that servers of Triple Pattern Fragments need to follow.
        This means that clients of Triple Pattern Fragments
        MUST NOT need prior knowledge of a server,
        i.e., they MUST NOT assume a certain IRI pattern.
        Instead, clients MUST interpret the hypermedia control in each Triple Pattern Fragment
        in order to retrieve another fragment.
        Clients MUST NOT attempt to deconstruct IRIs of fragments,
        i.e., they MUST treat these as opaque identifiers.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          The hypermedia control fulfills the <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation.pdf">hypermedia constraint</a>
          that each representation should contain the controls towards next steps.
          As a result, clients can use Triple Pattern Fragments
          without any prior knowledge.
          This also means a server can freely choose
          the IRIs of its Triple Pattern Fragments,
          as well as the names of parameters
          (e.g., <code>subject</code>, <code>predicate</code>, <code>object</code>
                 instead of <code>s</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>o</code> in the above snippet).
        </p>
        <p>
          An equivalent hypermedia control for the above snippet could look as follows:
        </p>
<pre><code>&lt;form method="GET" action="http://example.org/example"&gt;
  &lt;fieldset&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;label for="subject"&gt;subject&lt;/label&gt;     &lt;input id="subject"   name="s" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;label for="predicate"&gt;predicate&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id="predicate" name="p" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;label for="object"&gt;object&lt;/label&gt;       &lt;input id="object"    name="o" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/fieldset&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="submit" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Clients can obtain the IRI of a specific fragment
        through a hypermedia control in fragments' representations.
        However, since hypermedia controls generally accept strings as input,
        we need to specify how to convert IRIs, literals, and variables to strings
        for use as <var>subject</var>, <var>predicate</var>, and <var>object</var> parameter values.
        The interface MUST at least support the following options:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>constant IRI</dt>

        If the RDF syntax supports multiple graphs,
        control triples MUST be serialized to a non-default graph.
        This non-default graph SHOULD be explicitly related to the Triple Pattern Fragment
        (for instance, using the <code>foaf:primaryTopic</code> predicate),
        so clients can interpret what resource the controls are related to.
        This graph MAY be the same as the graph containing the metadata.

      <h3>Paging</h3>
      <p>
        Triple Pattern Fragments SHOULD be paged to avoid overly large responses.
        A <dfn data-lt="Triple Pattern Fragment page">page</dfn> of a Triple Pattern Fragment
        consists of the following three parts:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>data / selector</dt>
        <dd>
          The page MUST contain a subset of data of the corresponding Triple Pattern Fragment.
          The data of a fragment SHOULD be distributed over pages of a given page size <var>n</var>
          by dividing an ordered list of matching triples in chunks of size <var>n</var>.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          Each data triple SHOULD only occur on one page of any given fragment.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          The page MAY additionally contain other triples of the dataset.
        </dd>
        <dt>metadata</dt>
        <dd>
          The page MUST be linked to its corresponding Triple Pattern Fragment
          using <code>hydra:view</code>.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          The page SHOULD contain all metadata of the fragment.
          In particular, it MUST contain a triple
          with a <code>void:triples</code> predicate
          that expresses the estimated total number of matches for the fragment's triple pattern.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          The page MAY contain additional metadata.
        </dd>
        <dt>hypermedia controls</dt>
        <dd>
          A page SHOULD contain all hypermedia controls of the fragment.
          In particular, it MUST contain those controls
          that allow retrieval of any Triple Pattern Fragment of the dataset.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          If a previous page directly precedes the page,
          this page MUST link to it using <code>hydra:previous</code>.
          The previous page SHOULD NOT be empty.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          If a next page directly follows the page,
          this page MUST link to it using <code>hydra:next</code>.
          The next page SHOULD NOT be empty.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          The page MAY contain additional hypermedia controls.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
        A page is considered <dfn data-lt="empty page">empty</dfn>
        if it does not contain any data triples (regardless of metadata and controls).
      </p>

      <p>
        Pages MAY be accessible by page number through an additional hypermedia control.
        In any case, clients MUST NOT attempt to deconstruct IRIs of pages,
        i.e., they MUST treat these as opaque identifiers.

    <h2>Triple Pattern Fragments servers</h2>
    <section id="server-definition">
      <h3>Definition</h3>
      <p>
        A server can make one or more datasets available as Triple Pattern Fragments.
        For a server to be called a <dfn>Triple Pattern Fragments server</dfn>
        of a given dataset,
        it MUST offer access to <em>all</em> possible Triple Pattern Fragments of that dataset.
        Triple Pattern Fragments MAY be accessible through one or more representations,
        at least one of which MUST be RDF-based [[!RDF11-CONCEPTS]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Triple Pattern Fragment MUST follow the document type
        defined in <a href="#document-type"></a> and MUST be accessible through a canonical IRI.
        All representations supported by the server MUST be accessible through this canonical IRI;
        individual representations SHOULD NOT have their own IRI.
        Support for representations must be consistent,
        that is, if a Triple Pattern Fragment is available in a certain representation,
        then all of the Triple Pattern Fragments MUST be available in that representation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Triple Pattern Fragments servers MAY additionally offer access
        to other Linked Data Fragments of the dataset.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="informative">
      <h3>HTTP-based implementation</h3>
      <p>
        As an example, we consider how a Triple Pattern Fragments interface
        could be implemented on top of the HTTP protocol [[RFC7230]].
      </p>

      <p>
        A server assigns IRIs to all possible
        (pages of) Triple Pattern Fragments of its datasets.
        How IRI assignment happens is implementation-dependent;
        this choice is communicated to clients
        through the <a href="#controls">hypermedia controls</a> of fragments' representations.
      </p>
      <aside class="example" title="Choosing IRIs for Triple Pattern Fragments">
        <p>
          All of the following are possible IRI templates [[!RFC6570]]
          for Triple Pattern Fragments.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>http://example.org/dataset?subject={subject}&amp;predicate={predicate}&amp;object={object}</code></li>
          <li><code>http://example.org/dataset?s={subject}&amp;p={predicate}&amp;o={object}</code></li>
          <li><code>http://example.org/mydata/fragments/{subject}/{predicate}/{object}/</code></li>
          <li>…</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is entirely up to the server to determine such templates (if desired)
          as part of its Web API.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given any Triple Pattern Fragment retrieved from a server,
          clients can determine the correct IRI to a fragment for a specific triple pattern
          by interpreting the <a href="#controls">hypermedia controls</a> in the retrieved fragment.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        A IRI of a fragment identifies the fragment resource, not a representation thereof.
        All representations are accessible through the fragment's canonical IRI
        using content negotiation [[RFC7230]].
        No specific IRIs are necessary for individual representations.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to allow browser applications to access fragments,
        Cross-Origin Resource Sharing [[CORS]] has to be enabled on the server.
        To this end, Triple Pattern Fragments servers should emit
        the following header and value on <em>all</em> HTTP responses to
        requests for Triple Pattern Fragments, regardless of their status code:
      </p>
      <pre><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code></pre>

      <p>
        As this example indicates, a Triple Pattern Fragments interface
        is fully defined by its document type (<a href="#document-type"></a>).
        No protocol-level agreements are necessary.
        In the case of HTTP, these are provided by the HTTP protocol itself.
