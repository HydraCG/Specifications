  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Coping with the ever-increasing amount of data becomes
    increasingly challenging. To alleviate the information overload put on
    people, systems are progressively being connected directly to each
    other. They exchange, analyze, and manipulate humongous amounts of
    data without any human interaction. Most current solutions, however,
    do not exploit the whole potential of the architecture of the World
    Wide Web and completely ignore the possibilities offered by Linked Data
    technologies.</p>

  <p>The combination of the REST architectural style and the Linked
    Data principles offer opportunities to advance the Web of machines
    in a similar way that hypertext did for the human Web. Most
    building blocks exist already and are in place but they are rarely
    used together. Hydra tries to fill that gap. It allows data to be
    enriched with machine-readable affordances which enable
    interaction. This not only addresses the problem that Linked Data
    is still mostly read-only, but it also paves the way for a
    completely new breed of interoperable Web APIs. The fact that it
    enables the creation of composable contracts means that
    interaction models of Web APIs can be reused at an unprecedented
    granularity.</p>

  <h2>Conformance</h2>

  <p>This specification describes the conformance criteria for
    <dfn data-lt="Hydra API documentation">Hydra API documentations</dfn>
    and <dfn data-lt="Hydra client">Hydra clients</dfn>. These criteria are
    relevant to authors, authoring tool implementers, and client
    implementers. All authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes
    in this specification are non-normative, as are all sections
    explicitly marked as non-normative. Everything else in this
    specification is normative.</p>

  <p class="issue">Conformance for Hydra clients should probably not be
    specified in this document.</p>

  <p class="issue">Add normative statements</p>

  <p>The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
    SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this
    specification have the meaning defined in [[!RFC2119]].</p>

<section class="informative">
  <h2>Hydra at a Glance</h2>

  <p>The basic idea behind Hydra is to provide a vocabulary which enables a
    server to advertise valid state transitions to a client. A client can
    then use this information to construct HTTP requests which modify the
    server’s state so that a certain desired goal is achieved. Since all
    the information about the valid state transitions is exchanged in a
    machine-processable way at runtime instead of being hardcoded into the
    client at design time, clients can be decoupled from the server and
    adapt to changes more easily.</p>

  <p>The figure below illustrates the Hydra core vocabulary (the figure’s
    intention is to show how Hydra is used rather than its precise
    definition).</p>

  <p class="issue">Is this illustration clear enough or is it confusing?
    Feedback would be much appreciated.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Using Hydra</h2>

  <p>Throughout this section, a simple Web API featuring an issue tracker
    will be used to illustrate how Hydra can be used. The Web API enables
    its users to file new issues, modify or delete existing ones, and
    to comment them. For the sake of simplicity, orthogonal aspects such
    as authentication or authorization are not covered.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Adding Affordances to Representations</h3>

    <p>The exemplary Web API has to expose representations of issues and
      comments. To enable interaction with those resources, a client has
      to know which operations the server supports. In human-facing
      websites such affordances are typically exposed by links and forms
      and described in natural language. Unfortunately, machines can not
      interpret such information easily. The solution that presents itself
      is to reduce the language to a small number of unambiguous concepts
      which are easily recognizable by a machine client. Hydra formalizes
      such concepts.</p>

    <p>The simplest and most important affordance on the Web are
      hyperlinks. Without them, it would be impossible to browse the Web.
      Users typically select the link based on the text it is labeled
      with. To give machines a similar understanding, links can be
      annotated with a link relation type&mdash;a registered token or a
      URI identifying the semantics of the link. The following example
      shows how such a typed link is used in HTML to reference a
      stylesheet.</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="A typed link referencing a stylesheet as used in HTML">
      <!--
      <link ****rel="stylesheet"**** href="http://www.example.com/styles.css" />
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>In Linked Data, the link relation type corresponds to the property
      itself. An example in JSON-LD would thus look as follows.</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Referencing a stylesheet in JSON-LD">
      <!--
      {
        ****"urn:iana:link-relations:stylesheet"****: { "@id": "http://www.example.com/styles.css" }
      }
      -->
    </pre>

<!--     <p class="note">The <code>urn:iana:link-relations:stylesheet</code> URN
      is not officially registered (yet). For the moment, see
      <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-saintandre-iana-urn">draft-saintandre-iana-urn</a>
      which defines this URN pattern.</p> -->

    <p>Generally, a client decides whether to follow a link or not based on
      the link relation (or property in the case of
      Linked Data) which defines its semantics. There are however also
      clients such as Web crawlers which simply follow every link
      intended to be dereferenced. In HTML this usually means that all
      links in anchor elements (the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag) are
      followed but most references in link elements (the
      <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag), such as used in the example above,
      are ignored. Since in RDF serializations no such distinction exists,
      the best a client can do is to blindly try to dereference all URIs.
      It would thus be beneficial to describe in a machine-readable manner
      if a property represents a link intended to be
      dereferenced or solely an identifier. Hydra's
      <i>Link</i> class does just that. It can be used to define properties
      that represent dereferenceable links. In the exemplary Web API used
      throughout this section, it can be used to define a property
      linking issues to their comments:</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Defining properties representing hyperlinks using Hydra's Link class">
      <!--
      {
        "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/context.jsonld",
        "@id": "http://api.example.com/vocab#comments",
        ****"@type": "Link"****
      }
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>In the example above, a property identified with the URL
      <code>http://api.example.com/vocab#comments</code> is defined to be
      of the type <i>Link</i>. This is enough information for a client
      understanding Hydra to know that the value of the
      <code>comments</code> property in the following example is intended
      to be dereferenced.</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Using a property defined to be a hyperlink">
      <!--
      {
        "@context": {
          ****"comments": "http://api.example.com/vocab#comments"****
        },
        "@id": "http://api.example.com/an-issue",
        "title": "An exemplary issue linking to its comments",
        ****"comments": { "@id": "http://api.example.com/an-issue/comments" }****
      }
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>In the example above, the value of the <code>comments</code>
      property is a JSON object with an <code>@id</code> member. This is
      JSON-LD's convention to distinguish between strings and IRIs. By
      using JSON-LD's type-coercion feature, the representation can be
      made even more idiomatic:</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Using JSON-LD's type-coercion feature to create idiomatic representations">
      <!--
      {
        "@context": {
          "comments": { "@id": "http://api.example.com/vocab#comments", ****"@type": "@id"**** }
        },
        "@id": "http://api.example.com/an-issue",
        "title": "An exemplary issue linking to its comments",
        "comments": ****"http://api.example.com/an-issue/comments"****
      }
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>While links are enough to build read-only Web APIs, more powerful
      affordances are required to build read-write Web APIs. Thus, Hydra
      introduces the notion of operations. Simply speaking, an
      <i>Operation</i> represents the information necessary for a client
      to construct valid HTTP requests in order to manipulate the server's
      resource state. As such, the only required property of an
      <i>Operation</i> is its HTTP <i>method</i>. Optionally, it is
      also possible to describe what information the server <i>expects</i>
      or <i>returns</i>, including additional information about HTTP
      status codes that might be returned. This helps a developer to
      understand what to expect when invoking an operation. This
      information has, however, not to be considered as being complete;
      it is merely a hint. Developers should, e.g., expect that other
      HTTP status codes might be returned and program their clients
      accordingly.</p>

    <p>The following example illustrates how representations can be
      augmented with information that enables clients to interact with
      them.</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="A representation of an issue augmented with a delete operation">
      <!--
      {
        ****"@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/context.jsonld"****,
        "@id": "/an-issue",
        "title": "An exemplary issue representation",
        "description": "This issue can be deleted with an HTTP DELETE request",
        ****"operation"****: [
          ****{
            "@type": "Operation",
            "method": "DELETE"
          }****
        ]
      }
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>The example above references Hydra's context to map properties such
      as <code>operation</code> and <code>method</code> and values like
      <code>Operation</code> to URLs that unambiguously
      identify these concepts. It would be similarly valid JSON-LD if
      these mappings would be directly embedded into the representation
      or if the full URLs would be used instead. Typically, however, the
      context is the same for a lot of representations in a Web API and
      it thus makes sense to reduce the response size by leveraging a
      remote context that can easily be cached by a client.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Documenting a Web API</h3>

    <p>In Web APIs, most representations are typically very similar.
      Furthermore, resources often support the same operations. It thus
      makes sense, to collect this information in a central documentation.
      Traditionally, this has been done in natural language which forces
      developers to hardcode that knowledge into their clients. Hydra
      addresses this issue by making the documentation completely
      machine-processable. The fact that all definitions can be identified
      by URLs enables reuse at unprecedented granularity.</p>

    <p>Hydra's <i>ApiDocumentation</i> class builds the foundation for
      the description of a Web API. As shown in the following example,
      Hydra describes a API by giving it a title, a short description, and
      documenting its main entry point. Furthermore, the classes known to
      be supported by the Web API and additional information about status
      codes that might be returned can be documented. This information
      may be used to automatically generate documentations in natural
      language.</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="The overall structure of a Hydra API documentation">
      <!--
      {
        "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/context.jsonld",
        "@id": "http://api.example.com/doc/",
        ****"@type": "ApiDocumentation"****,
        ****"title"****: ####"The name of the API"####,
        ****"description"****: ####"A short description of the API"####,
        ****"entrypoint"****: ####"URL of the API's main entry point"####,
        ****"supportedClass"****: [
          ####... Classes known to be supported by the Web API ...####
        ],
        ****"possibleStatus"****: [
          ####... Statuses that should be expected and handled properly ... ####
        ]
      }
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>In Linked Data, properties are, just as everything else, identified
      by IRIs and thus have global scope which implies that they have
      independent semantics. In contrast, properties in data models as
      used in common programming languages are class-dependent. Their
      semantics depend on the class they belong to. In data models classes
      are typically described by the properties they expose whereas in
      Linked Data properties define to which classes they belong. If no
      class is specified, it is assumed that a property may apply to every
      class.</p>

    <p>These differences have interesting consequences. For example, the
      commonly asked question of which properties can be applied to an
      instance of a specific class can typically not be answered for
      Linked Data. Strictly speaking, any property which is not explicitly
      forbidden could be applied. This stems from the fact that Linked Data
      works under an open-world assumption whereas data models used by
      programmers typically work under a closed-world assumption. The
      difference is that when a closed world is assumed, everything that
      is not known to be true is false or vice-versa. With an open-world
      assumption the failure to derive a fact does not automatically imply
      the opposite; it embraces the fact that the knowledge is
      incomplete.</p>

    <p class="issue">Mention that Hydra classes are dereferenceable
      resources.</p>

    <p>Since Hydra uses classes to describe the information expected or
      returned by an operation, it also defines a concept to describe the
      properties known to be supported by a class. The following example
      illustrates this feature. Instead of referencing properties directly,
      <i>supportedProperty</i> references an intermediate data structure,
      namely instances of the <i>SupportedProperty</i> class. This makes
      it possible to define whether a specific property is required or
      whether it is read-only or write-only depending on the class it is
      associated with.</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Defining a class and documenting its supported properties">
      <!--
      {
        "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/context.jsonld",
        "@id": "http://api.example.com/doc/#Comment",
        ****"@type": "Class"****,
        ****"title"****: ####"The name of the class"####,
        ****"description"****: ####"A short description of the class."####,
        ****"supportedProperty"****: [
          ####... Properties known to be supported by the class ...####
          {
            ****"@type": "SupportedProperty"****,
            ****"property"****: "#property", ####// The property####
            ****"required"****: true, ####// Is the property required in a request to be valid?####
            ****"readable"****: false, ####// Can the client retrieve the property's value?####
            ****"writeable"****: true ####// Can the client change the property's value?####
          }
        ]
      }
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>All instances of a specific class typically support the same
      operations. Hydra therefore features a <i>supportedOperation</i>
      property which defines the operations supported by all instances of
      a class.</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Defining a class and documenting its supported operations">
      <!--
      {
        "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/context.jsonld",
        "@id": "http://api.example.com/doc/#Comment",
        "@type": "Class",
        "title": ####"The name of the class"####,
        "description": ####"A short description of the class."####,
        "supportedProperty": [
          ####... Properties known to be supported by the class ...####
        ],
        ****"supportedOperation"****: [
          ####... Operations known to be supported by instances of the class ...####
        ]
      }
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>The same feature can be used to describe the operations supported
      by values of a <i>Link</i> property. This is often helpful when
      certain operations depend on the permissions of the current user. It
      makes it, e.g., possible to show a "delete" link only if the current
      user has the permission to delete the resource. Otherwise, the link
      would simply be hidden in the representation.</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Documenting the supported operations of link properties">
      <!--
      {
        "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/context.jsonld",
        "@id": "http://api.example.com/doc/#comments",
        ****"@type": "Link"****,

    <h3>Discovering a Hydra-powered Web API</h3>

    <p>The first step when trying to access a Web API is to find an entry
      point. Typically, this is done by looking for documentation on the
      API publisher's homepage. Hydra enables the API's main entry point
      to be discovered automatically if the API publisher marks his
      responses with a special HTTP Link Header as defined in [[RFC5988]].
      A Hydra client would look for a Link Header with a relation type
      <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#apiDocumentation</code> (this is
      the IRI identifying the <i>hydra:apiDocumentation</i> property).</p>

    <p>In the following example, a Hydra client simply accesses the
      homepage of an API publisher (<code>http://www.example.com</code>)
      to find the entry point of its API. A client may use an HTTP GET or
      HEAD request. The difference between the two is that the former may
      return a message-body in the response whereas the latter will not;
      otherwise they are identical.</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Discovering Hydra API documentation documents">
      <!--
      HEAD / HTTP/1.1
      Host: www.example.com

      ====================================

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
      ****Link: <http://api.example.com/doc/>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#apiDocumentation"****
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>The response in the example above contains an HTTP Link Header
      pointing to <code>http://api.example.com/doc/</code>.
      Retrieving that resource, the client would obtain a
      <a>Hydra API documentation</a> defining the API's main entry
      point:</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Retrieving a Hydra API documentation to obtain the main entry point">
      <!--
      GET /doc/ HTTP/1.1
      Host: api.example.com
      Accept: application/ld+json

      ====================================

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      Content-Type: application/ld+json

      {
        "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/context.jsonld",
        "@id": "http://api.example.com/doc/",
        "title": "The example.com API",
        ****"entrypoint": "http://api.example.com/"****,
        ...
      }
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>Please note that in most cases the entry point will already be
      known to the client. Thus, the discovery of the API documentation
      using HTTP Link Headers is typically not necessary as the concepts
      used in responses from the API will dereference to their
      documentation.</p>

  <h2>Advanced Concepts</h2>

  <p class="issue">Describe Hydra's Resource class? Or should that better be
    described somewhere in the beginning?</p>

  <section>
    <h3>Collections</h3>

    <p>In many situations, it makes sense to expose resources that reference
      a set of somehow related resources. Results of a search query or
      entries of an address book are just two examples. To simplify such
      use cases, Hydra defines the two classes <i>hydra:Collection</i> and
      <i>hydra:PartialCollectionView</i>.</p>

    <p>A <i>hydra:Collection</i> can be used to reference a set of resources
      as follows:</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Referencing related resources using a Hydra Collection">
      <!--
      {
        "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/context.jsonld",
        "@id": "http://api.example.com/an-issue/comments",
        ****"@type": "Collection"****,
        ****"totalItems": "4980"****,
        ****"member"****: [
          {
            "@id": "/comments/429"
          },
          {
            "@id": "/comments/781",
            "title": "Properties may be embedded directly in the collection"
          },
          ...
        ]
      }
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>As shown in the example above, member items can either consist of
      solely a link or also include some properties. In some cases embedding
      member properties directly in the collection is beneficial as it may
      reduce the number of HTTP requests necessary to get enough information
      to process the result.</p>

    <p>Since collections may become very large, Web APIs often chose to
      split a collection into multiple pages. In Hydra, that can be achieved
      with a <i>hydra:PartialCollectionView</i>. It describes a specific
      view on the collection which represents only a subset of the collection's
      members. A <i>PartialCollectionView</i> may contain links to the
      <i>first</i>, <i>next</i>, <i>previous</i>, and <i>last</i>
      <i>PartialCollectionView</i> which allows a client to find all members
      of a <i>Collection</i>.</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="A Hydra PartialCollectionView splits a collection into multiple views">

        "@type": "Collection",
        "totalItems": "4980",
        "member": [
          ####... a subset of the members of the Collection ...####
        ],
        ****"view"****: {
          "@id": "http://api.example.com/an-issue/comments?page=3",
          ****"@type": "PartialCollectionView"****,
          ****"first": "/an-issue/comments?page=1"****,
          ****"previous": "/an-issue/comments?page=2"****,
          ****"next": "/an-issue/comments?page=4"****,
          ****"last": "/an-issue/comments?page=498"****
        }
      }
      -->
    </pre>

    <p class="issue">Say that all these properties are optional? What about
      <i>first</i> and, perhaps more interestingly, <i>last</i>?</p>

    <h3>Templated Links</h3>

    <p>Sometimes, it is impossible for a server to construct a URL because
      the URL depends on information only known by the client. A typical
      use case are URLs which enable a client to query the server. In such
      a case, the server cannot construct the URL because it does not know
      the query the client is interested in. What the server can do however,
      is to give the client a template to construct such a URL at runtime.
      In Hydra, the <i>IriTemplate</i> class is used to do so.</p>

    <p>An <i>IriTemplate</i> consists of a <i>template</i> literal and a set
      of <i>mappings</i>. Each <i>IriTemplateMapping</i> maps a
      <i>variable</i> used in the template to a <i>property</i> and may
      optionally specify whether that variable is <i>required</i> or not.
      The syntax of the template literal is specified by its datatype and
      defaults to the [[!RFC6570]] URI Template syntax, which can be
      explicitly indicated by <i>hydra:Rfc6570Template</i>.</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Description of an IRI Template">
      <!--
      {
        "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/context.jsonld",
        ****"@type": "IriTemplate"****,
        ****"template": "http://api.example.com/issues{?q}"****,
        ****"variableRepresentation": "BasicRepresentation"****,
        ****"mapping"****: [
          {
            ****"@type": "IriTemplateMapping"****,
            ****"variable": "q"****,
            ****"property": "hydra:freetextQuery"****,
            ****"required": true****
          }
        ]
      }
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>The example above maps the variable <code>q</code> to Hydra's
      <i>freetextQuery</i> property and marks it as required.
      As its name suggests, the <i>freetextQuery</i> property can be used
      for free text queries.</p>

    <p>A template syntax only details how to fill out simple string values,
      but not how to derive such string values from typed values,
      language-tagged strings, or IRIs. Hydra addresses this by
      specifying how such values are to be serialized as strings. The
      serialization of an <i>IriTemplate's</i> variables can be described
      by setting the <i>variableRepresentation</i> property to
      <i>BasicRepresentation</i> or <i>ExplicitRepresentation</i>. The
      <i>BasicRepresentation</i> represents values by their lexical form. It
      omits type and language information and does not differentiate between
      IRIs and literals. The <i>ExplicitRepresentation</i>, on the other
      hand, includes type and language information and differentiates
      between IRIs and literals by serializing values as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>IRIs are represented as-is.</li>
      <li>Literals, i.e., (typed) values and language-tagged strings are
        represented by their lexical form, surrounded by a single pair of
        doubles quotes (<code>"</code>).</li>
      <li>If a literal has a language, a single <code>@</code> symbol is
        appended after the double-quoted lexical form, followed by a
        non-empty [[BCP47]] language code.</li>
      <li>If a literal has a type, two <em>caret</em> symbols
        (<code>^^</code>) are appended after the double-quoted literal,
        followed by the full datatype IRI.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In both representations characters MUST NOT be escaped. In case the
      representation format is not explicitly described, clients SHOULD
      use the <i>BasicRepresentation</i> by default.</p>

    <p class="warning">Although <i>ExplicitRepresentation</i> use of
      <code>@</code> and <code>^^</code> is similar, it is <em>not</em> the
      same as the [[Turtle]] representation for literals. Turtle literals
      require escaping of special characters, surround datatype IRIs with
      angular brackets (<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>), and also
      allow single quotes (<code>'</code>) to indicate literals.
      <i>ExplicitRepresentation</i> values must not be escaped, IRIs must
      not be surrounded by any character, and only double quotes can
      indicate literals.</p>

    <p>Below are some example values serialized in the different
      representations as well as the result of expanding the IRI template
      <code>http://example.com/find/{value}</code> with the respective
      value.</p>

    <p>Similar to how Hydra's <i>Link</i> class allows the definition of
      properties that represent hyperlinks as described in
      <a class="sectionRef" href="#adding-affordances-to-representations"></a>,
      the <i>TemplatedLink</i> class allows the definition of properties
      whose value are IRI templates. Hydra predefines one such property,
      namely the <i>search</i> property which can be used to document
      available search interfaces.</p>

    <h3>Description of HTTP Status Codes and Errors</h3>

    <p>HTTP status codes have well defined semantics and can be used to
      signal the outcome of an operation. Unfortunately, however, HTTP
      status codes by themselves are often not specific enough, making it
      difficult to understand the real cause of an error. For
      instance, a <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> response is rarely
      informative enough by itself. To address this issue, Hydra defines
      a <i>Status</i> class which allows additional
      information to be associated with an HTTP status code.</p>

    <pre class="example nohighlight" data-transform="updateExample"
         title="Associating additional information to an HTTP status code">
      <!--
      {
        "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/context.jsonld",
        "@type": "****Status****",
        ****"statusCode": 429****,
        "title": "Too Many Requests",
        "description": "A maximum of 500 requests per hour and user is allowed.",
        ...
      }
      -->
    </pre>

    <p>An <i>ApiDocumentation</i> or an <i>Operation</i> may document the
      status codes that might be returned by the server using the
      <i>possibleStatus</i> property as described in
      <a class="sectionRef" href="#documenting-a-web-api"></a>. This allows
      a developer to understand what to expect when invoking an operation.
      It has, however, not to be considered as an extensive list of all
      potentially returned status codes; it is merely a hint. Developers
      should expect to encounter other HTTP status codes as well.</p>

    <p>A server may also return a <i>Status</i> directly in
      a response. When doing so, it often makes sense to subclass the
      <i>Status</i> to make its semantics more explicit.
      Hydra defines just one such subclass, namely the <i>Error</i> class.
      This provides an extensible framework to communicate error details to
      a client.</p>
